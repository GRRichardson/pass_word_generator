This program was created as a project for my MSU bootcamp
I believe this project is an accurate representaion of my lack of knowledge at the time of creation; while the application ultimately works, my coding is inefficient, and beyond taking me an entire restart, caused me more stress and took more time than needed.
Ultimately this shoddy work will stand as a point of comparison to my future growth.
